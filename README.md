# Krong season 2
Organised by Wiolarz a regular meeting with people interested in learning Godot.
This time each meeting will have it's own separete branch

Brawler Project was split into 3 parts:
Basic - simplest game logic for the first lesson with AI logic
Simple - incorrectly used physics system, but works really well
