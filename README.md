# Krong season 2
Organised by Wiolarz a regular meeting with people interested in learning Godot.
This time each meeting will have it's own separete branch


# Brawler
Is a single player adaptation of https://wiolarz.itch.io/plated-ghosts
which aims to add "vampire survivors" gameplay


Brawler Project was split into 3 parts:
Basic - simplest game logic for the first lesson with AI logic
Simple - incorrectly used physics system, but works really well
Rest: My early attempts at making the godot physics system work


Problems with each usage of physics:
Simple - when I increase an object's weight they start to move faster, when I decrease their weight they start to move slower.
It's problematic because I want to provide players with a nice ability to push away hordes of enemies with ease.


Rest - Previous working scripts act incorrectly for unknown reasons. To move anything I have to apply extreme forces (thousands of KG for most basic motion)
