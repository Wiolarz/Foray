# Krong 3 - Polyspear

Polyspear is a turn based strategy game.

Inspirations include
- chess (no random element)
- heroes (game structure)
- asymetric multiplayer strategy games \
(intentionally designed imbalance,\
compensated by skill gap, allies, diplomacy etc)

Developed as a part of "Krąg Godota", a community organised by Wiolarz
for people interested in learning Godot with regular weekly meetings.
Part of Polygon gamedev enthusiasts organisation.

Currently polyspear is the main project Krong is working on.
