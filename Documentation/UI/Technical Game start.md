Everything starts with a `_ready()`: from `game_setup.gd` depending on the setting it either starts:

`_on_button_battle_pressed()` or `_on_button_world_pressed()`

which mainly influences: `IM.game_setup_info.game_mode` And in terms of UI launches: `_select_setup_page(selected_UI_scene)`

  

# Game mode neutral

`_prepare_to_start_game()` Itâ€™s always launched without arguments

# Battle map

  

# World map
