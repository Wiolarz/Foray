# Economy

## Basics
Player has 3 types of resources:
 - Wood
 - Iron
 - Ruby

They can be gathered at locations:
 - Sawmill
 - Mine
 - Cave


## Game opening - hero choice

Player starts a game with a handful of resources and a single starting city.
To progress he needs to buy one of the 3 available heroes, each with different power and cost.

### 1 (Cheap)
- almost free
- average early game
- fastest mid game -> strongest
- fastest late game -> but weakest

Aggresive option, has to always play the game fast

### 2 (Average)
- Decent cost
- low early game resources -> weak early game
- decent scaling -> average mid game
- average late game

Safest option, needs to play defensive mid game against 1(cheap) and has to force timing attack against 3(expensive)

### 3 (Expensive) 
- Costs all starting ruby
- Strong hero -> provides easier early game
- Caps early city progression  -> forcing hard mid game
- Slowest late game  -> high level on best hero

Cheese, can rush opponents resource outposts but has to camp during mid game hoping to survive to late game
