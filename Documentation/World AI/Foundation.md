Currently World AI is made to be weak enough that even on harder Battle AI difficulty player will still have a chance.
Once world gameplay will be finished there could be a possibility of big world refactor enabling implementation of smaller scale MCTS or other algorithms making world AI powerful.



Currently the goal to make playing against AI opponents "fun" is to provide them with various "unique" personalities, so that players may see varied gameplay on the world map.
