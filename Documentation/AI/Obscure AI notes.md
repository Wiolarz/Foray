For Battle AI C++ optimization a lot of stuff like number of spells present in a battle is limited (for example to a maximum of 80)  
As for current design it’s more than enough space. But in case a “modder” decided to have fun and spawn a lot of different mages, he could run into crashes related to Battle AI C++ not working properly.
