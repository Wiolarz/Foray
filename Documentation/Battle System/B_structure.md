# Battle notes

## Ideas:

Game could allow for more sides participate in a single battle. Requirements:
Special map that has more spawn point groups
For alliances -> friendly fire detection for other player units
Proper result handling

## TODO

Players at the start of the battle have to place their units.

Only the current players units are shown at the bottom in a nice "select your unit view"
other participants are relegated side bar showing their faction color (+ hero if present, if absent icon of the strongest unit)
upon hovering over that faction, their roster is shown instead

Modify general approach to:
get army input
give army output

think if you prefer to hide unit buttons or to destroy them
