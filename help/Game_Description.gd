Crowd stealth game

During this meeting, we will create a movement system for player character.

Game rules:

Player has to reach the box at the end of the level while avoiding police spotting him,
range of detection for police is shown by a red circle around player character.
When a player get's close to human characters with the same clothing as he,
his detection range gets smaller "he gets lost in the crowd".



Things to do:

Add a movement system for the player that collides with walls.

Add slower movement under "SNEAK" button

*bonus Add change of clothes based on nearby civilians
