# Game Description
"""
Brawler is a single player version 'Plated Ghosts' where the gameplay shifted into a 'Vampire Survivors' clone.
Basic premise is that fighting is done with phycics based weapons.

Controls:
WASD / arrow keys - movement
Q+E / F+G - weapon rotation



Characters in order to move use their stamina bar. Upon its depletion movement speed is heavily slowed down.
Regeneration of stamina is constant but doubles if it's above 50% of the bar. The additional stamina bar regenerates more slowly,
but can provide that necessary push in a pinch.



Spikes located around the map inflict damage, while pits instantly kill.
